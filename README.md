## RESTful Routes


<br>

## Difficulites Faced


- How to differenciate the roles when user login and show different pages
- How to connect different models and make it work (E.g. populate the data, connect the backend and frontend)
- How to make the functions work in ejs
- The route send a Json data when I do the res.render
- Different routes in a same page (when user click the back button, it will go back to the class list as a teacher instead of story list as a student)
